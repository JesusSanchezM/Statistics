if we replicate 7 experiments with 9 different possible values to get in each experiment, with a probability of 0.20 that event "9" happens, our histogram graph will have a bell shape

```{r echo=TRUE}
a <- replicate(10^3, rbinom(7, 9, 0.20)) 
ggplot() + geom_bar(aes(a))
```

the closer our sample is from our population, the closer to a uniform distribution we'll be

```{r}
a <- replicate(10^2, (sample(9, 1))) 
ggplot() + geom_bar(aes(a))
a <- replicate(10^5, (sample(9, 1))) 
ggplot() + geom_bar(aes(a))
sum(a==8)/length(a) 
table(a)
```
